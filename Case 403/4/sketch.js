Case 403 - Captured - stage 4

A coordinated action is under way to arrest Shiffman. Police are currently in pursuit on Huffman Street.
In order to catch him we must be able to alert all forces of his whereabouts according to the following rules:

- if Shiffman is within 102 meters from Smalltalk Speakeasy then alert local police by drawing a Cyan circle around it with a radius of 102 pixels.
- if Shiffman is in Wrong Side of the tracks then the neighbourhood watch must be notified by drawing a DarkOrchid rectangle around it.
- if Shiffman is in neither position, a global alert must be issued by drawing a FireBrick rectangle covering the area between Turing Place, Berners-Lee Street, Huffman Street and Leodorf Way.

Shiffman's position is signified by the mouse.

Note: all road coordinates are measured from their center.

Use X11 colours. You can find a reference table at https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-iccprof#numerical.

There are many possible ways of investigating this case, but you should use ONLY the following commands, operators and variables:

  if(){}
  >
  <
  &&
  else
  fill()  - Use r,g,b values between 0 and 255.
  dist()
  ellipse()
  rect()
  mouseX
  mouseY
